The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this scenario, the `.parent .child` selector has higher specificity than `.child`, yet the `!important` declaration on `.child` overrides it.  This unexpected behavior is due to the `!important` declaration overriding the specificity rules.
