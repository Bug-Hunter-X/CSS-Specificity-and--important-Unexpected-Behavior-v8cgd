To resolve this issue, avoid using `!important`. Instead, refactor the CSS to use more specific selectors. If you must use !important it is recommended to use it sparingly. Here's a possible solution:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

/* Or if you absolutely must use !important, ensure the selector specificity is higher than the other declarations. */
.parent .child {
  color: green !important;
}

/* Or consider using a separate class altogether */
.parent .child.highlight {
 color: orange !important;
}

```

By restructuring the CSS, we rely on the natural specificity of selectors to determine the correct styling, avoiding reliance on `!important`.
